                            To use retro.js you must first link it to the html
                            file that will be hosting the game. First create an
                            html file and a javascript file. Here the files will
                            be shown as index.html and index.js.

                            In place of "js/retro.js" you should put the
                            location of retro.js, similarly do the same with
                            "js/index.js".

                        <p>
                            Next, we'll set up our index.js file by adding in a
                            few lines
                        </p>

                            see if there are any errors. If so make sure
                            retro.js and your index.js files are in the right

                            this point on. It is not really needed after the
                            next line which creates a new board with the
                            demensions of 1000x600.

                            A retro shooter needs enemies and of course a
                            player. In this section we will add those features
                            in.

                        <p>
                            We can only createPlayer once. After passing in a
                            player image location, width and height, we're ready
                            to go. With the player having been created we can
                            now specify a location for our projectile image.
                            This is done on the second line. Adding a non player
                            sprite has an additional argument; in the second
                            spot after the image path, we have to specify the
                            sprites id. ids are unique.
                        </p>
                        <p class="small">
                            Make sure not to ever directly specify "Player" as
                            an id as this is reserved for the player and is
                            automatically done for you when calling createPlayer

                            Also note that the game board will always have an id
                            of "Game". Factor this is when naming sprites

                            At this point the game should be playable with the
                            user moving with W,A,S,D key and the L key to shoot.
                            We may choose to remap these keys by reassigning the
                            UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT and SHOOT properties of your
                            game instance.

                            Making Use of Collisions
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Right now, the enemy and the player can tell that
                            they are touching each other but nothing is
                            happening. What we have to do is specify a
                            collisionBehavior for each sprite if we want it to
                            do something on collision. Also, we are able to
                            shoot the enemy but nothing is happening. Below
                            we're going to add these functionalities in.
                        </p>
                        <img src="img/collision-behaviour.PNG" />
                        <p>
                            A few things are happening here. First, we figure
                            out what collided with the enemy. So far there are
                            only two possibilities, the player or the player's
                            projectiles. We check to see if the collider is the
                            player and specify a behaviour. We destroy the
                            player if this is the case. Alternatively, if a
                            projectile hits the enemy we want the enemy to be
                            destroyed and increment the player's score. Finally
                            this function is useless if it is not assigned as
                            the enemy's collisionBehavior function. Note: the
                            variable 'me' here is unused but shows how can get
                            the enemy to be used in whatever way you want. Such
                            me.hitpoints = 4 and then decrementing it each hit.
                        </p>
                        <p class="small">
                            All projectile ids are in the form "proj" plus a
                            number usually the current count of shots fired by
                            its owner. ex proj100 is the 100th shot. So we can
                            use the first 4 letters of a sprites id to determine
                            if it is a projectile.
